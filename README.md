### Preface

- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
- With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services
- Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration
- Docker Compose simplifies the development, testing, and deployment of complex applications

---

## Docker Compose Overview

- Docker Compose allows you to `define multiple services` in a single YAML file.
- Services can be `linked together` through networks and dependencies.
- Compose manages the `entire application lifecycle`.

### Key Benefits

- **Simplified Multi-Container Management**: Define and run multiple containers with a single command
- **Environment Consistency**: Ensure the same environment across development, testing, and production
- **Service Dependencies**: Control the startup order and dependencies between services
- **Network Isolation**: Create isolated networks for your application components
- **Volume Management**: Persist data and share files between containers and the host

### Docker Compose File Structure

- A `docker-compose.yml` file defines your application's services, networks, and volumes
- **Services**: Define the containers that make up your application
- **Networks**: Create custom networks for service communication
- **Volumes**: Manage data persistence and sharing

### Core Concepts

#### `version`

- Specifies the Compose file format version
- Different versions support different features
- Latest version provides the most features and compatibility

#### `services`

- The main section where you define your application containers
- Each service represents a single container
- Services can be built from Dockerfiles or use existing images

#### `networks`

- Define custom networks for service communication
- Services on the same network can communicate using service names
- Provides isolation between different application components

#### `volumes`

- Define named volumes for data persistence
- Share data between containers
- Persist data beyond container lifecycle
