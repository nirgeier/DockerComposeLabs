# Advanced Docker Compose Setup

This `docker-compose.yaml` file defines an advanced multi-container application setup. Below is a detailed explanation of its components and configurations:

---

## Version

The Compose file uses version `3.9`, which supports the latest Docker Compose features.

---

## Services

### 1. `service1`

- **Image**: Specifies the Docker image to use for this service.
- **Build**: If applicable, defines the build context and Dockerfile.
- **Ports**: Maps host ports to container ports for external access.
- **Environment Variables**: Configures environment-specific settings for the service.
- **Volumes**: Mounts host directories or named volumes into the container for data persistence or configuration.
- **Networks**: Connects the service to one or more custom networks for inter-service communication.
- **Restart Policy**: Defines the conditions under which the container should restart (e.g., `always`, `on-failure`, `unless-stopped`).

### 2. `service2`

- Similar configurations as `service1`, tailored to the specific requirements of this service.

---

## Volumes

- **Named Volumes**: Used for persisting data across container restarts.
- **Bind Mounts**: Maps host directories to container paths for sharing files or configurations.

---

## Networks

- **Custom Networks**: Enables isolated communication between services while allowing external access if required.

This Compose file demonstrates advanced configurations for building, deploying, and managing multi-container applications. It is designed to be flexible and scalable for complex use cases.
