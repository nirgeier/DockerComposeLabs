## 01 - Intro.md

- This guide will walk you through creating a basic `docker-compose.yml` file, focusing on the most common features that allow you to easily define and manage complex multi-container application environments.
- Docker Compose is a powerful tool for orchestrating and running your `Dockerized` applications.

## 1. What is Docker Compose?

- Docker Compose is a :wrench: tool for defining and :running: running multi-container `Docker` applications.
- With `Docker Compose`, you use a `YAML` file to configure your application's services.
- Then, with a simple command(s), you create and start all the services from your configuration.
- This greatly simplifies the development, testing, and deployment of complex applications.
- It allows you to define the services, networks, and volumes your application needs in a single file (`docker-compose.yml`), making it easy to manage and share your application setup.
- Docker Compose is particularly useful for local development, `CI/CD pipelines`, and orchestrating **multi-container** applications.

## 2. Installing Docker Compose

### 2.1. Docker-Desktop for Windows and macOS

- If you are using Docker Desktop for Windows or macOS, Docker Compose is included by default.

### 2.2. Linux

- If you are using Linux, you might need to install it separately.
- Please refer to the official Docker documentation for installation instructions: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- You can install it using the official Docker Compose package for your Linux distribution.
- For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:

```bash
# Install Docker Compose using apt-get
sudo apt-get install docker-compose
```

- Or, if you prefer to install it manually, you can download the binary from the official GitHub repository:

```bash
# Install from GitHub repository and move it to /usr/local/bin
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

- Verify your installation by running:

    ```bash
    # Verify Docker Compose installation
    docker compose version

    # For older versions
    docker-compose --version

    # Or if using macos and installing using brew
    brew info docker-compose

    ==> Caveats
    Compose is a Docker plugin. For Docker to find the plugin, add "cliPluginsExtraDirs" to ~/.docker/config.json:
    "cliPluginsExtraDirs": [
        "/opt/homebrew/lib/docker/cli-plugins"
    ]

    ```

### 2.3. Install on MacOS using Homebrew

- If you are using macOS, you can install Docker Compose using Homebrew:

```bash
# Install Docker Compose using Homebrew
brew install docker-compose

# After installation, you can verify it by running:

# Verify Docker Compose installation
docker compose version  
```
